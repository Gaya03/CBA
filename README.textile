h1. CBA - Community Base Application

is "Rails3-Mongoid-Devise by fortuity":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise extended by Andi Altendorfer with

* OmniAuth
* Paperclip
* CanCan

h2. Installation

At the moment installation is a matter of change. The documentation will follow as soon as the installation process will be worked out cleanly. 

Thou there is one thing you should know: You have to set role 'admin' to your first user!
Afer signing up your first user open your console and do this with

  rails console
  u=User.first
  u.roles=['admin']
  u.save

h2. Delayed Jobs

There is a rake-task to start the background jobs

<code>rake delayed_jobs:work</code>

Unfortunatley "DelayedJobs by 'tobi'":http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job doesn't work with MongoId.
So I did this my own way. To define new background-workers follow this steps:

# Define a worker in <code>app/workers</code> (See new_sign_up_notifier.rb for example)
# Enqueue new Jobs like shown in <code>app/model/user.rb</code>, method <code>async_notify_on_creation</code>

h2. Resource 'Page'

Since nearly any website needs some kind of 'semi-static pages' and we need some kind of object to test the application, there is a resource Page with the following features

# Consists of a title and a body
# The body is rendered with _RedCloth_
# The MongoId of <code>/page/MONGO_ID</code> in the browser-address will be replaced by <code>/p/title_of_the_page</code> with JS.
