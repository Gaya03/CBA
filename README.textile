h1. CBA - Community Base Application

is "Rails3-Mongoid-Devise by fortuity":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise extended by Andi Altendorfer with

* OmniAuth
* Paperclip
* CanCan

h2. Installation

At the moment installation is a matter of change. The documentation will follow as soon as the installation process is worked out cleanly. 


h2. Delayed Jobs

There is a rake-task to start the background jobs

<code>rake delayed_jobs:work</code>

Unfortunatley "DelayedJobs by 'tobi'":http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job doen't work with MongoId.
So I did this my own way. To define new background-workers follow this steps:

# Define a worker in <code>app/workers</code> (See new_sign_up_notifier.rb for example)
# Enqueue new Jobs like shown in <code>app/model/user.rb</code>, method <code>async_notify_on_creation</code>
