CBA is based on Rails3-Mongoid-Devise
=====================================

Rails3-Mongoid-Devise
---------------------

Original by "fortuity" at http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise

You can use this project as a starting point for a Rails web application. 
It requires Rails 3 and uses Mongoid http://mongoid.org/ for data storage 
and Devise http://github.com/plataformatec/devise for user management and 
authentication.
